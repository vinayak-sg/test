The transition from Botpress to Botpress X was a huge game changer, and the latest one from Botpress X to Botpress Server (v11) is even bigger.

> **Note:** Botpress Server is in public beta and is not ready for production usage just yet. We are working hard to stabalize the API and performances before the end of the year.

## What's new in Botpress Server

There are 4 major differences between Botpress X (10.x) and Botpress Server (11.x).

- **v11** is not an NPM library anymore – it is a standalone application. We distribute binaries of v11 for OSX, Windows, Linux and Docker on a daily basis.
- **v11** now supports multiple bots natively – thus the naming of Botpress Server.
- **v11** is a complete backend rewrite to TypeScript. We have made significant architectural changes [that are not backward-compatible](/docs/migrate).
- We introduced our first version of [Botpress Native NLU](/docs/build/nlu)

With Botpress Server, we went back to the roots and completely rewrote the engine from scratch using Typescript. Multi-bot support was added natively. We are giving a much bigger place to modules, which can do a lot more than before. We expose a new SDK that makes it very easy to develop for Botpress.

### Other minor changes

- Modules can now deploy [Actions](/docs/build/code)
- Modules can export static assets
- [Hooks](/docs/build/code) have been added to replace `bp.hear` in your `index.js` file
